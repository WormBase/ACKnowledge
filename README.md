# WormBase Author First Pass system (AFP)

AFP is a semi-automated curation tool that periodically extracts biological entities from newly published research articles on *C. elegans* and emails out corresponding authors, who can review and modify/confirm the extracted information and submit curated data to WormBase through a dedicated web interface.

Additional tools in the AFP system include software to send automated reminder emails to authors who have not completed their submissions, a notification system to inform curators at WormBase about new author submissions related to their data type of interest, and a dashboard for curators to monitor AFP submissions and to 'diff' extracted vs. submitted data.
