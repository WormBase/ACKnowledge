<p>ACKnowledge (previously known as "Author First Pass") is a semi-automated curation tool that periodically extracts biological entities from newly published research
    articles on *C. elegans* and emails out authors, who can review and modify/confirm the extracted
    information and submit curated data to WormBase through a dedicated web interface.</p>

<p>Additional tools in the ACKnowledge system include software to send automated reminder emails to authors who have not completed
    their submissions, a notification system to inform curators at WormBase about new author submissions related to their
    data type of interest, and a dashboard for curators to monitor submissions and to 'diff' extracted vs. submitted
    data.</p>

<p>The ACKnowledge project is supported by grant RO1 OD023041 from the National Library of Medicine at the US National Institutes of Health.</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Version 3.0</h3>

<h4> Release Date</h4>
09-16-2021

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Based on valuable user feedback, we continue to improve the ACKnowledge experience.  In addition to providing more
    streamlined ways to enter entities, weâ€™ve added further instructions for adding new entities, and a link to look up
    specific entities in WormBase.  We now flag papers for enzymatic activity and include a free-text field to describe
    other gene functions.  We updated the FAQs and provide a link to the ACKnowledge webinar presented in February 2021.
    Lastly, to thank authors for their valuable contributions, we now acknowledge authors on WormBase person and paper pages.</p>

<p>We have implemented updates and improvements to our curator dashboard. The dashboard is a tool available to WormBase
    curators to  keep track of submissions and perform quality control of submitted data.</p>

<h4>Main Features</h4>

    <li>Added download button for lists of papers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 2.0</h3>

<h4>Release Date</h4>
09-14-2020

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>We improved the ACKnowledge system based on feedback received from authors and statistics
    collected during one year of ACKnowledge v1.0 author submissions. We improved the definition of
    data types in the form and we refined our text mining algorithms to obtain better results.</p>

<h4>Main Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented [TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf#:~:text=In%20information%20retrieval%2C%20tf%E2%80%93idf,in%20a%20collection%20or%20corpus.) in place of simple thresholds to improve precision of gene and allele recognition</li>
    <li>Improved datatype descriptions in "?" mouse-overs</li>
    <li>Added FAQs and Release Notes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0</h3>

<h4>Release date</h4>
06-03-2019

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>We are proud to introduce our new ACKnowledge system, which leverages text mining to help authors curate
    their papers and send data to WormBase! The system replaces the previous form which required authors
    to submit data manually through free-text forms.</p>

<h4>Main Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Automated extraction of biological entities from articles based on text mining</li>
    <li>Extracted entities presented to author for validation through a newly designed web form</li>
    <li>Additional data types can be manually entered by authors</li>
    <li>Dashboard for curators to monitor submissions</li>
    <li>Monthly notifications to curators with newly submitted data</li>
    <li>Periodic email reminders to authors</li>
    <li>More details in [our paper](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baaa006/5809234) published on Database</li>
</ul>
