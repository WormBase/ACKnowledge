  content_to_author: "Dear Author,<br/>
                      We have identified you as an author for the recently published paper:<br/>
                      <br/>
                      \"{}\", {}<br/>
                      <br/>
                      We are contacting you for help in alerting a WormBase curator to data that need to be extracted<br/>
                      from your paper and entered into our database.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      If you would like to flag* your paper for detailed curation, please click <a href={}>here</a>.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      *Flagging your paper involves validating automatically extracted entities and identifying the types of data present, and should take <20 minutes.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      Please feel free to forward the link to a co-author if you are unable to complete the form at this time.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      In addition, WormBase has recently launched microPublication Biology, a peer-reviewed journal<br/>
                      that publishes citable, single experimental results, such as those often omitted from standard<br/>
                      journal articles due to space constraints or confirmatory or negative results. If you have such<br/>
                      unpublished data generated during this study, we encourage you to submit it
                      <a href=https://www.micropublication.org/submit-new-article/>here</a>.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      You can view all your papers already in the ACKnowledge system on the 
                      <a href=https://acp.acknowledge.textpressolab.com>Author Curation Portal</a>.<br/>
                      <br/>

                      information about flagging your paper for curation or Micropublication.<br/>
                      Please accept our congratulations on your publication!<br/>

                      We are happy to announce that we’ve released a new version of the ACKnowledge form.<br/>
                      We’ve improved our methods for identifying relevant genes and alleles, and added an FAQs section
                      to help guide you through the process. <br/> Full details are available in the
                      <a href=\"https://github.com/WormBase/author-first-pass/tree/master#release-notes\">V3 Release Notes</a>.<br/>
