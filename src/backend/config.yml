                      We have identified you as the corresponding author for the recently published paper:<br/>

                      <br/>
                      We are contacting you for help in alerting a WormBase curator to data that need to be extracted<br/>
                      from your paper and entered into our database.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      If you would like to flag* your paper for detailed curation, please click <a href={}>here</a><br/>
                      <br/>
                      *Flagging your paper involves identifying the types of data present and should take <10 minutes.<br/>

                      In addition, WormBase has recently launched microPublication Biology, a peer-reviewed journal<br/>
                      that publishes citable, single experimental results, such as those often omitted from standard<br/>
                      journal articles due to space constraints or confirmatory or negative results. If you have such<br/>
                      unpublished data generated during this study, we encourage you to submit it
                      <a href=https://www.micropublication.org/submit-new-article/>here</a>.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      Please contact <a href='mailto:help.afp@wormbase.org'>help.afp@wormbase.org</a> or
                      <a href='mailto:contact@micropublication.org'>contact@micropublication.org</a> if you would like more<br/>
                      information about flagging your paper for curation or Micropublication.<br/>

                      We are happy to announce that we’ve released a new version of the Author First Pass (AFP) form.<br/>
                      We’ve improved our methods for identifying relevant genes and alleles, and added an FAQs section
                      to help guide you through the process. <br/> Full details are available in the
